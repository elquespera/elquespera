### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is **Pavel**, and I love building **web applications**. I focus on **clean code** and layouts with a **friendly UX**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently **working on** [Free ATMs](https://github.com/elquespera/free-atms), a web service that allows users to view and share information on ATM withdrawal fees across the globe.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently **learning** about integrating Next.js middleware with user authentication through Firestore.

- ðŸ“« **Get in touch** with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-grinkevich) or through my [portfolio](http://pavelgrinkevich.com#contact).

- ðŸ’» I love to solve coding problems on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/elquespera).
